    <h2>Critique for NY Times Covid-19 Visualization</h2>

        <p>
            Here, I will be critiquing the NY Times visualization depicting the number cases of the Covid-19 Omicron variant
            in the United States through 2020 and 2021. To start with, this unique design does a few things well; its spiral
            nature makes it easy to compare the relative amount of cases during the same month and time of year across both years,
             and it's easy to see the ebb and flow of cases rising and falling over time. The radial grid lines, shading, and labels
             help clearly lay out the timeline for any prospective readers.</p>
        <p>However, there are some areas where the design falls short.
            For example, the spiraling layout and lack of numerical reference for magnitude (apart from the small portion on top)
            make it hard to clearly understand the actual numbers and range being shown. And even the small reference at the top
            (showing the thickness difference between 0 and 150 thousand cases) is held separate from the spiral at the top left,
            and doesn’t really work well visually in terms of placement and working as an actual reference for the numbers being
            shown.
        </p>

    <h2>Sketches</h2>

    <h3>Sketch 1:</h3>

    <img src="../images/A3.png" alt="a picture of a line graph">

    <ul>
        <li>I chose this graph because of its classic nature. Everyone has seen a line graph before, and the information
            is presented in a very straightforward way that should leave no room for misunderstanding
        </li>
        <li>It’s very easy to directly compare months and seasons across years and to see trends over time. It also does a better job
            of emphasizing differences in magnitude
        </li>
        <li>Simple, effective, but plain. Not super creative or memorable, which may lessen its impact among viewers
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sketch 2:</h3>

    <img src="../images/A3_2.png" alt="a picture of a radialline graph">

    <ul>
        <li>I chose to go with this design in particular because it preserved the circular nature of the original design,
            and I added concentric grid lines and markers to act as a reference for magnitude to see if that would improve
            the design issue
        </li>
        <li>I wanted it to do essentially the same thing as the original design, and use a circular format to highlight
            and compare changing trends over the two years during similar time periods and seasons. I then tried to see
             if the tweaks I made helped with the issue of scale, but I think the mixture of colors (blue and orange)
              and the circular (instead of spiral) nature of the graph actually made it harder to understand for most viewers
        </li>
       <li>I chose orange and blue to contrast against each other, but I think the lines are too light and made it hard
        to read and understand
       </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sketch 3:</h3>

    <img src="../images/A3_3.png" alt="an image of a stacked bar graph">

    <ul>
        <li>
            I chose to go with this design because it allows not just for a comparison of cases by yearly
             quarter for both years, but also a total comparison of cases by year as well
       </li>

       <li>Other designs focused more on looking strictly at the monthly totals, but this allows us to still focus
         on that while also getting the bird’s eye view as well to see how it all piles up
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Visualization:</h3>

    <img src="../images/heatmap_cov.png">

    <ul>
        <li> I wanted try using colors as opposed to lines or shapes to contrast the trends seen in confirmed cases
            through both years
       </li>
       <li>Alternatively, I also used color-coded my heatmap with shades ranging from yellow to red, a
        shade range that should instinctively evoke understanding due to it naturally occuring (in fire and other hot things).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Writeup</h3>

    <p>Through my visualizations, I am trying to convey a story of the ebb and flow of a pandemic across time. I don’t just
        want the viewer to look at 2020 and 2021 as separate years and events, but as two mirrored parts of an overarching
        pandemic that came and went in waves. This is why I experimented with more radial patterns and lines, as while bars
        and other sectional graphs can show change over time I wanted to create something that directly compared similar months
         and seasons across both years for readers to view simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>I experimented with representing contrasting time periods with cool and warm-toned colors, so I paired orange and
        blue as well as blue and green in order to visually demarcate the years to compensate for them being physically
        overlaying each other. I also used shades of yellow to red to evoke a color-scale seen in nature, to help make sure viewers
        could instinctively contrast periods of time.
         I also tried to address the issue of scale I critiqued in the original visualization, and
        provided grids and tick marks on the charts themselves so as to serve as a useful reference for magnitude. Through
        these decisions, I was able to effectively show how the number of confirmed cases changed throughout the course of
         the year when comparing 2020 and 2021, and I believe that I was able to effectively address my other main issue of
          a proper scale of reference for magnitude not being present as well. Although I will say that in focusing on these
          factors that I’ve highlighted I did lose the unique style and appeal of the NY Times design, which may lessen its
           impact among audiences. My radial chart, although working off of a similar principle and idea as the spiral, may
            be confusing for viewers unfamiliar with that type of design.
